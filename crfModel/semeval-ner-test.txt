We	O

that	O

E	O

Inequality	B-KP
(22)	O
indicates	O
that	O
the	O

the	O
loosest	O

Fortunately,	O
this	O
loosest	O
constraint	O
would	O
not	O
seriously	O
affect	O
the	O

the	O

comparable	O

that	O

the	O

The	O

number	O

possible	O

under	O
a	O

[24].	O
	
This	O
would	O
greatly	O

the	O

finding	O
a	O

On	O
the	O

hand,	O
checking	O
the	O
maximum	B-KP

sounds	O
more	O
reasonable	O
than	O
checking	O
the	O

Therefore,	O
we	O
chose	O
the	O
maximum-norm	B-KP

our	O
criterion	O
for	O
designing	O
the	O

The	O

an	O

For	O

Such	O

[34,35].	O
	
Indeed,	O
ATRP	I-KP

However,	O
the	O

For	O

the	O

[32].	O
	
Due	O

the	O

this	O

Notice	O

Finally,	O

Since	O

it	O

This	O

the	O

We	O

Our	O

Pairwise	B-KP

As	O

this	O

Since	O

the	O

For	O

the	O

all	O

If	O
one	O

a	O
P-state,	O
the	O
orbital	B-KP
wave	I-KP

so	O

the	O

Rhodamines	I-KP

Molecular	O

are	O
well-known	O
[27,28]	O
and	O
indicate	O
that	O
all	O
the	O

non-centrosymmetric.	O
	
In	O
general,	O
for	O

TPA	I-KP

forbidden	O
when	O

the	O

However,	O
for	O

the	O
single-photon	I-KP

So	O
we	O

the	O

on	O
the	O

The	O
other	O
methods	O
for	O
enhancement	B-KP
of	I-KP
photocatalytic	I-KP

are	O
grafting	O
co-catalysts.	B-KP
	
There	O
are	O
two	O
kinds	O
of	O
co-catalysts	B-KP
in	O

of	O
its	O

one	O
is	O
for	O
separation	B-KP
of	I-KP
electrons	B-KP
and	O
the	O
other	O
is	O
for	O
separation	B-KP
of	I-KP

The	O
former	O
representative	O
co-catalysts	B-KP
are	O
Pt,	B-KP
Fe3+,	B-KP
and	O
Cu2+	B-KP
[9–12].	O
	
It	O
was	O
reported	O
that	O
Fe3+	B-KP

into	O
Fe2+	B-KP

Cu+	B-KP

one	O

[11,12].	O
	
The	O
reduced	B-KP
metal	I-KP
oxide	I-KP
cluster	I-KP
with	O
reduced	B-KP

could	O
return	O

the	O

by	O
giving	O
more	O

one	O
electron	B-KP

The	O

ones	O
are	O
CoOx,	B-KP

IrOx,	O

the	O
most	O

for	O

[13].	O
	
However,	O
there	O
were	O

reports	O
concerning	O
co-grafting	I-KP
effects	O
on	O
photocatalytic	I-KP
activity	I-KP
especially	O
in	O

We	O
expected	O
that	O
by	O
co-grafting	I-KP
of	O
both	O
co-catalysts	I-KP

separations	O
of	O
electrons	I-KP

photocatalytic	I-KP
activity	I-KP
in	O
gaseous	I-KP

would	O
be	O
further	O

Moreover,	O

of	O
BiVO4	I-KP

the	O
other	O

of	O
p-type	I-KP

An	O

A	O

A	O

When	O

we	O

however,	O
the	O

Minimizing	O
the	O

is	O
problematic,	O
since	O
they	O
may	O

Even	O
with	O
an	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
risk	O

treating	O
the	O

unequally	O
or	O
getting	O

a	O

Firstly,	O
we	O
can	O

what	O

the	O

Thus,	O
designing	O
an	O

is	O
difficult	O
and	O
one	O
would	O
need	O

the	O

the	O

Secondly,	O
adding	O
multiple,	O

objectives	O
very	O
likely	O
results	O
in	O
a	O
fitness	O

with	O

which	O
makes	O

To	O
