The	B-KP

Section	O

the	O

explicitly	O

In	O
Section	O
2.4,	O
the	O
continuum	O

taken	O
only	O
because	O
our	O

to	O
derive	O
the	O

Therefore	O
it	O

Two	O

First,	O
a	O

the	O

Second,	O
the	O

Interestingly,	O
the	O
single	O

shows	O
the	O

the	O

(Figure	O

Previous	O

have	O
shown	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
main	O
mechanisms	O
for	O
the	O
development	B-KP
of	I-KP
radiation-induced	B-KP
DSBs	I-KP
[16,17].	O
	
For	O
γ-ray	B-KP
radiation,	I-KP
single	B-KP

is	O
the	O
main	O
process	O
to	O
cause	O
DSBs	B-KP
(see	O
Figure	O

which	O
is	O
attributed	O
to	O
the	O

ROS	B-KP
upon	O
the	O
incident	O
of	O
individual	O

Whereas	O
photo-radiation	B-KP
causes	O
DSBs	B-KP
through	O
two	B-KP
step	I-KP
mechanism	I-KP
(Figure	O

by	O
reflecting	O
that	O
each	O
single	O

causes	O
mostly	O
single	O
ROS	B-KP
and	O
thus	O
induces	O
only	O
single	B-KP
strand	B-KP
break.	I-KP
	
Then,	O
when	O
a	O
second	O
single	B-KP
strand	B-KP
break	I-KP
occurs	O
where	O
near	O
the	O
existing	O

i.e.,	O
the	O
two	B-KP

Summarizing	O
the	O
results	O
and	O
discussion	O
we	O
may	O
conclude	O
as	O
that:	O
(1)	O
The	O
significant	O
protective	O
effect	O
of	O
AA	B-KP
against	O
photo-induced	B-KP
damage	I-KP
may	O

the	O

AA.	B-KP
	
(2)	O
For	O
the	O
γ-ray	B-KP
induced	I-KP
DSB,	I-KP
the	O
protective	O
effect	O
by	O
AA	B-KP
is	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
weaker	O
than	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
photo	B-KP
irradiation.	I-KP
	
This	O
may	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
generation	O
of	O
numbers	O
of	O
ROS	B-KP
by	O
single	B-KP

of	I-KP

Surviving	O

(3)	O
As	O
for	O
the	O

caused	O
by	O
the	O

through	O
the	O

[18].	O
	
Thus,	O
the	O
chemical	O
effect	O
of	O
AA	B-KP
to	O
diminish	B-KP
ROS	B-KP
is	O
considered	O
to	O

that	O

However,	O
when	O
it	O

especially	O
in	O
a	O

way,	O
microscopy	I-KP
sometimes	O

due	O

the	O

In	O
contrast,	O
the	O

methods	I-KP
provide	O
much	O
a	O
superior	O
statistical	O
accuracy	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
microscopy	I-KP
simply	O
because	O
the	O
observation	O

is	O
larger	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
microscopes.	O
	
One	O
must	O
remember,	O
however,	O
that	O
the	O
scattering	I-KP
methods	I-KP
normally	O
require	O
“(hypothesized)	I-KP

for	O

They	O

We	O

The	O

For	O

the	O

Even	O

The	O

Thus,	O
the	O

This	O

The	O

this	O
Letter	O

to	O

First,	O

Second,	O

The	O

this	O

nothing	O

to	O
bring	B-KP

More	O

we	O

Moreover,	O

We	O
aim	O
at	O

via	O

the	O

We	O
show	O
that	O

It	O

these	O

This	O
observation	O

the	O

here,	O
even	O

it	O

Certainly	O
therefore	O
the	O

it	O

Another	O

In	O
this	O

the	B-KP

get	O

Therefore	O
we	O

perform	O

that	O

In	O

In	O

also	O

We	O

construct	O

under	O
both	O

We	O

a	O

In	O
fact,	O
there	O
are	O
more	O

pairs,	I-KP
since	O
many	O
of	O
the	O

can	O

observed	O
as	O
either	O

Note	O
that	O

written	O
in	O
terms	O

VV	O
final	O

while	O
others	O
are	O
have	O
PP	O
states.	O
	
There	O
are	O
three	O
reasons	O
for	O
this.	O
	
First,	O
some	O
decays	B-KP
involve	O
a	O
final-state	O
π0.	O
	
However,	O
experimentally	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
find	B-KP
the	I-KP
decay	I-KP
vertices	I-KP
of	O
the	O
final	B-KP
particles.	I-KP
	
This	O
is	O
virtually	O
impossible	O
for	O
a	O
π0,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
always	O
use	O
a	O
ρ0.	O
	
Second,	O
some	O
pairs	B-KP
of	I-KP
decays	I-KP
are	O
related	O
by	O
SU(3)	O
in	O
the	O
SM	B-KP
only	O
if	O
an	O
(ss¯)	O
quark	B-KP
pair	I-KP
is	O
used.	O
	
However,	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
P's	O
which	O
are	O
pure	O
(ss¯).	O
	
The	O
mesons	B-KP
η	B-KP
and	O
η′	B-KP
have	O
an	O
(ss¯)	O
component,	O
but	O
they	O
also	O
have	O
significant	O
(uu¯)	O
and	O
(dd¯)	O
pieces.	O
	
As	O
a	O
result	O
the	O
b¯→s¯	O
and	O
b¯→d¯	O
decays	B-KP
are	O
not	O
really	O
related	O
by	O
SU(3)	O
in	O
the	O
SM	B-KP
if	O
the	O
final	O
state	O
involves	O
an	O
η	B-KP
or	O
η′.	B-KP
	
We	O
therefore	O
consider	O
instead	O
the	O
vector	B-KP
meson	I-KP
ϕ	B-KP
which	O
is	O
essentially	O
a	O
pure	O
(ss¯)	O
quark	B-KP
state.	I-KP
	
Finally,	O
we	O
require	O
that	O
both	O
B0	B-KP
and	O
B¯0	B-KP
be	O
able	O
to	O
decay	B-KP
to	I-KP
the	I-KP
final	I-KP
state.	I-KP
	
This	O
cannot	O
happen	O
if	O
the	O
final	O
state	O
contains	O
a	O
single	O
K0	O
(or	O
K¯0)	O
meson.	B-KP
	
However,	O
it	O
can	O
occur	O
if	O
this	O
final-state	B-KP
particle	I-KP
is	O
an	O
excited	B-KP
neutral	I-KP
kaon.	I-KP
	
In	O
this	O
case	O
one	O
decay	O
involves	O
K*0,	B-KP
while	O
the	O
other	O
has	O
K¯*0.	B-KP
	
Assuming	O
that	O
the	O
vector	B-KP
meson	I-KP
is	O
detected	O
via	O
its	O
decay	B-KP
to	I-KP
ψKsπ0	B-KP
(as	O
in	O
the	O
measurement	B-KP
of	I-KP
sin2β	I-KP
via	O
Bd0(t)→J/ψK*),	O
then	O
both	O
B0	B-KP
and	O
B¯0	B-KP
can	O
decay	B-KP
to	O
the	O
same	O
final	O
state.	O
	
If	O
signals	O
suggesting	O
supersymmetry	B-KP
(SUSY)	B-KP
are	O
discovered	O
at	O
the	O
LHC	O
then	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
vital	O
to	O
measure	I-KP
the	I-KP
spins	I-KP

the	I-KP

to	O
demonstrate	I-KP
that	I-KP
they	I-KP
are	I-KP
indeed	I-KP
the	I-KP

A	O

The	O

a	B-KP

that	O
BEBC	B-KP

Therefore,	O

The	O

However,	O

In	O

Letter,	O
we	O

results	O

a	O

of	I-KP
decay	I-KP

in	O
the	O
framework	B-KP
of	I-KP
full	I-KP
Salpeter	I-KP

The	O
full	O
Salpeter	B-KP
equation	I-KP
is	O
a	O
relativistic	B-KP
equation	I-KP
describing	O
a	O

Since	O
this	O
method	O
has	O
a	O
very	O
solid	O
basis	O
in	O
quantum	B-KP
field	I-KP

it	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
in	O
describing	B-KP
a	I-KP
bound	I-KP
state	I-KP
which	O
is	O
a	O
relativistic	B-KP
system.	I-KP
	
In	O
a	O
previous	O
paper	O
[16],	O
we	O
solved	B-KP
the	I-KP
instantaneous	I-KP
Bethe–Salpeter	B-KP

[17],	O
which	O
is	O
also	O
called	O

Salpeter	I-KP

[18].	O
	
After	O
we	O
solved	B-KP
the	I-KP
full	I-KP
Salpeter	I-KP
equation,	I-KP
we	O
obtained	O
the	O
relativistic	B-KP
wave	I-KP
function	I-KP
of	I-KP
the	I-KP
bound	I-KP

We	O
used	O
this	O

to	O
calculate	B-KP
the	I-KP

the	O
heavy	B-KP

a	O

and	O
obtained	B-KP

which	O
agree	O
very	O
well	O
with	O
recent	O
experiments.	O
	
We	O
also	O
found	O
there	O
that	O
the	O

are	I-KP
quite	I-KP

and	O
cannot	O
be	O
ignored	O
[16].	O
	
In	O
this	O
Letter	O
we	O
use	B-KP
this	I-KP
method	I-KP
to	O
predict	B-KP
the	I-KP
values	I-KP
of	I-KP
decay	I-KP
constants	I-KP
of	O
heavy	B-KP

in	O
0−	O

Our	O
aim	O
is	O
to	O
introduce	B-KP

mesons	I-KP
in	O

of	O
a	O
Lagrangian	B-KP
which	O
satisfies	O
the	O

One	O

a	O
non-linear	B-KP

[6].	O
	
In	O
this	O
theory	O
the	O
vector	B-KP

emerge	O
as	O

vector	I-KP
mesons.	I-KP
	
The	O
three	O

is	O
given	O

(11)ih4〈Vμ(P∂μP−∂μPP)〉,	O
where	O
h	B-KP

for	O
the	O

Some	O

of	I-KP
ρ's	I-KP

(12)π+(p1)π−(p2)ρ0:h(p1−p2)μεμ,π+(p1)π0(p2)ρ−:h(p1−p2)μεμ,K+(p1)K¯0(p2)ρ−:h2(p1−p2)μεμ,etc.,	B-KP
which	O

the	O
ρ	B-KP

Γ(ρ)=h2(|pπ|)3/(6πmρ2),	B-KP
where	O

in	I-KP
the	I-KP
ρ	I-KP

With	O
Γ(ρ)=149.2MeV,	O
we	O
find	O
h=5.95.	O
	
We	O
note	O
in	O
passing	O
that	O
the	O
Kawarabayashi–Suzuki–Riazuddin–Fayyazuddin	B-KP
relation	I-KP
gives	O
the	O
value	O
h=mρ/(2fπ)[12].	O
	
Thus	O
the	O

of	O
h	O
in	O
Eq.	O
	
(4)	O
and	O
the	O
two	O

The	O

The	O

In	O

On	O

Indeed,	O

In	O

This	O

the	O

the	I-KP

Tack	B-KP
is	O
an	O
important	O
property	O
of	O
a	O
PSA	B-KP
as	O
it	O
quantifies	O
its	O
ability	O
to	O
form	O
instantly	O
a	O

when	O

a	O

The	O

of	O
the	O

are	O
influenced	O
by	O
numerous	O

the	O

Therefore,	O
tack	O
is	O
important	O
in	O
many	O
applications	O
where	O
an	O

required,	O

it	O

when	O
a	O

is	O
desirable.	O
	
Many	O

the	O

The	O

The	O

the	I-KP

Since	O

We	O

Using	O

These	O

demonstrate	O
that	O
SW-SVR	B-KP
predicts	O

with	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
lowest	O

compared	O
with	O
standard	B-KP

In	O

we	O
found	O
that	O

built	O
from	O
very	O

for	O

However,	O
there	O
are	O
problems	O
to	O

solved	O
in	O
SW-SVR.	B-KP
	
Firstly,	O
the	O

performance	O
of	O
SW-SVR	B-KP
sometimes	O
deteriorates	O
despite	O
an	O

of	O

In	O

this	O

occurred	O
under	O
the	O

that	O

are	O
6	O
h	O
as	O
shown	O
in	O
Fig.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
data	O
extracted	O
by	O
D-SDC	B-KP
involves	O
unnecessary	O
training	B-KP
data	I-KP
for	O
highly	O
accurate	O

If	O
D-SDC	B-KP
extracts	O
the	O

data	O
as	O
the	O

data	O
when	O
training	O
periods	O
are	O
shorter,	O
the	O

of	O
SW-SVR	B-KP
never	O
deteriorates	O
due	O
to	O
an	O
increase	O
of	O
training	B-KP

Therefore,	O
we	O
must	O
review	O
both	O
feature	O

and	O
algorithms	O
of	O
D-SDC	B-KP
so	O
as	O
to	O
avoid	O
extracting	O
unnecessary	O

Meanwhile,	O
SW-SVR	B-KP
is	O
based	O
on	O
a	O
combination	B-KP
of	I-KP
several	I-KP
algorithms:	I-KP

PLS	B-KP
regression,	I-KP
k-means,	B-KP
D-SDC,	B-KP
and	O
linear	B-KP
SVR.	I-KP
	
Moreover,	O
each	O
algorithm	O
has	O
several	O
parameters.	O
	
Therefore,	O
SW-SVR	B-KP
has	O
more	O
varied	O
parameters,	O
and	O
it	O
takes	O
more	O
time	O
to	O

the	I-KP

In	O
this	O

we	O
used	O
a	O

roughly	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
decide	O
the	O

in	O
a	O

However,	O
there	O
is	O

for	O

the	B-KP

Consequently,	O

For	O

For	O

The	O

On	O

In	O

the	O
